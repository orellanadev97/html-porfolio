        <p>
            Frankfurt am Main is Germany’s most international city and a major European hub thanks to its huge international airport. It is also the economic centre of Germany (and Europe for that matter), which is reflected in its towering skyscrapers; a feature that you’ll find nowhere else in the country.

    <h2>Cologne (Köln)</h2>

        <p>
            Having been founded by the Romans, Cologne is one of Germany’s oldest cities and its beautiful architecture from various time periods reflects its long history. Stroll past old Roman towers, Gothic churches and then past the contrast of modern architecture. Don’t miss a visit to Cologne Cathedral, which took 600 years to complete. A visit to the Chocolate Museum alone is worth making the trip here!

    <h2>Hamburg</h2>

        <p>
            Germany’s second-largest city, Hamburg, is located in the north of the country only a few hours from Berlin. It is a port city and boasts one of the biggest harbours in Europe. Strolling over its many bridges and canals makes it easy to understand why it has been nicknamed the ‘Venice of the North’.
